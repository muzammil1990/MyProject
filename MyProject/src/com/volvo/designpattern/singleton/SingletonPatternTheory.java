>> Singleton Pattern : Def- says just " define a class that has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it".
 OR
             a class must ensure that only single object should be created and single object can be used by all other classes.
    
             
>> There are two forms of singleton design pattern

     1. Early Instantiation: creation of instance/object at load time.
     2. Lazy Instantiation: creation of instance/object when required.
    
>> Advantage of Singleton design pattern
     Saves memory because object is not created at each request. Only single object is reused again and again. 
 
>> Usage of Singleton design pattern
     Singleton pattern is mostly used in multi-threaded and database applications. 
     It is used in logging, caching, thread pools, configuration settings etc.

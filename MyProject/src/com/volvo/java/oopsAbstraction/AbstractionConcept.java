//    DEF: Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.
//    EG: sending SMS where you type the text and send the message. You don't know the internal processing about the message delivery.
    
    
    /*Ways to achieve Abstraction:  only 2 ways
    1. Abstract class( 0 to 100%) : since abstract class can have both complete and incomplete methods
    2. Interface (100%) */  
    
    
// RULES:
//    An abstract class must be declared with an abstract keyword.
//    It can have both abstract and non-abstract methods.
//    It cannot be instantiated. (no object)
//    It can have constructors and
//    It can have static methods also.
//    It can have final methods which will force the subclass not to change the body of the method.
// if all  members of a class are static we should declare class as abstract; to avoid object creation and members can be called
// using classname

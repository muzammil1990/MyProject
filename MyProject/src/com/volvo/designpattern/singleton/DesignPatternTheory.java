>>> Design Patterns in Java
    A design patterns are well-proved solution for solving the specific problem/task.
    
    Problem Given:
        Suppose you want to create a class for which only a single instance/object should be created and that 
        single object can be used by all other classes.

    Solution:
        Singleton design pattern is the best solution of above specific problem. So, every design pattern has some specification 
        or set of rules for solving the problems. What are those specifications, you will see

        
 >>> Advantage of design pattern:
     1. They are reusable in multiple projects.
     2. They provide the solutions that help to define the system architecture.
     3. They capture the software engineering experiences.
     4. They provide transparency to the design of an application.
     
>>> When should we use the design patterns?  
        We must use the design patterns during the analysis and requirement phase of SDLC(Software Development Life Cycle).   
        
>>> Categorization of design patterns:
    Basically, design patterns are categorized into two parts:

     1. Core Java (or JSE) Design Patterns.
     2. JEE Design Patterns.
     
>>> category: Core Java (or JSE) Design Patterns. (to remember: C.S.B = creational /Strucural/Behavioural)
            
             I.Creational Design Pattern
                 1. Singleton Pattern
                 2. Factory Pattern
                 3. Builder Pattern.
                 4. Prototype Pattern
                 6. Object Pool Pattern
         
             II. Structural Design Pattern  (to remember- A,B,C,D  -Adapter .....) 
                 1. Adapter Pattern
                 2. Bridge Pattern
                 3. Composite Pattern
                 4. Decorator Pattern
                 5. Facade Pattern
                 6. Flyweight Pattern
                 7. Proxy Pattern
         
            III. Behavioral Design Pattern
                1. Of Responsibility Pattern
                2. Command Pattern
                3. Interpreter Pattern
                4. Iterator Pattern
         
                5. Mediator Pattern
                6. Memento Pattern
                7. Observer Pattern
                8. State Pattern
         
                9. Strategy Pattern
                10.Template Pattern
                11.Visitor Pattern
     
>>> category: JEE Design Patterns.  
    J2EE design patterns are built for the developing the Enterprise Web-based Applications.
    
    I. Presentation Layer Design Pattern
    
        Intercepting Filter Pattern
        Front Controller Pattern
        View Helper Pattern
        Composite View Pattern
        
    II. Business Layer Design Pattern
    
        Business Delegate Pattern
        Service Locator Pattern
        Session Facade Pattern
        Transfer Object Pattern
        
    III. Integration Layer Design Pattern
    
        Data Access Object Pattern
        Web Service Broker Pattern

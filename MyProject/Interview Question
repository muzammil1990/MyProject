Q. Interface- how to access variable

Q. What are Desired Capabilities?

Q. What are generics?
A: We can hold only a single type of objects in generics. It doesnot allow to store other objects. = TypeSafety
Advantage of using generics
1.TypeSafety
2.Type casting is not required
3.Compile-Time Checking: It is checked at compile time so problem will not occur at runtime



Q: How to count the no. of objects created in a class?
A: Use static variable and constructor concept. have built a program on this.
   package: com.volvo.java.oopsConcept = Count_StaticVar

Q: Difference between Groupid and artifact id?

Q: Difference between close() and quit()

Q: Difference between click() and submit()
A: 
	click(): 
 1. can be performed anywhere in the webpage
 2.when we perform click() and If this causes a new page to load, we should discard all references 
 to this element and also any operations performed on this element bcoz it will throw a
  StaleElementReferenceException. = If the element no longer exists as initially defined

 3. if click() is done then the method will _not_ wait for the next page to load
 
 Submit()
 
  1. will work if submit button should be inside <form> tag and element type="submit" as below
 <form>
 <input id="submitbutton" name="submitbutton" type="submit" value="Next step" class="g-button g-button-submit">
 </form>
 
2. If this causes the current page to change, then this method will block until the new page is loaded.

3. If the given element is not within a form = @throws NoSuchElementException

Q: Difference between get() and navigate().to()
A:
navigate()=  Allows the driver to access the browser's history and to navigate to a given
   URL.
get(): Load a new web page in the current browser window. This is done using an HTTP GET operation,
   and the method will block until the load is complete.

}


Q: HTTP Protocol series : 100 to 500?
A: 1. Information responses(100-199)
  		100 = Continue = This interim response indicates that the client should continue the request or ignore the response if the request is already finished.
  		101 = Switching Protocols = This code is sent in response to an Upgrade request header from the client and indicates the protocol the server is switching to.
  		102 = Processing (WebDAV) = This code indicates that the server has received and is processing the request, but no response is available yet.
  		103 = Early Hints = This status code is primarily intended to be used with the Link header, letting the user agent start preloading resources while the server prepares a response.
  		
   2. Successful responses(200-299)
   		200= OK = The request succeeded. The result meaning of "success" depends on the HTTP method:

					GET: The resource has been fetched and transmitted in the message body.
					HEAD: The representation headers are included in the response without any message body.
					PUT or POST: The resource describing the result of the action is transmitted in the message body.
					TRACE: The message body contains the request message as received by the server.
		
		
	
   3. Redirection messages(300-399)
       
   4. Client error responses(400-499)
        400 = Bad Request = The server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing). 
        401 = Unauthorized = Although the HTTP standard specifies "unauthorized", semantically this response means "unauthenticated". That is, the client must authenticate itself to get the requested response.
        402 = Payment Required = This response code is reserved for future use. The initial aim for creating this code was using it for digital payment systems, however this status code is used very rarely and no standard convention exists.
        403 = Forbidden = The client does not have access rights to the content; that is, it is unauthorized, so the server is refusing to give the requested resource. Unlike 401 Unauthorized, the client's identity is known to the server.
        404 = Not Found = The server can not find the requested resource. In the browser, this means the URL is not recognized. In an API, this can also mean that the endpoint is valid but the resource itself does not exist. Servers may also send this response instead of 403 Forbidden to hide the existence of a resource from an unauthorized client. This response code is probably the most well known due to its frequent occurrence on the web.
        405 = Method Not Allowed = The request method is known by the server but is not supported by the target resource. For example, an API may not allow calling DELETE to remove a resource.
        406 = Not Acceptable = This response is sent when the web server, after performing server-driven content negotiation, doesn't find any content that conforms to the criteria given by the user agent.
        407 = Proxy Authentication Required = This is similar to 401 Unauthorized but authentication is needed to be done by a proxy.
        408 = Request Timeout = This response is sent on an idle connection by some servers, even without any previous request by the client. It means that the server would like to shut down this unused connection. This response is used much more since some browsers, like Chrome, Firefox 27+, or IE9, use HTTP pre-connection mechanisms to speed up surfing. Also note that some servers merely shut down the connection without sending this message.

Q2: Unauthorised vs Forbidden?
Ans: 
	They are both part of  HTTP Protocol series = 400
	  401 = Unauthorized = Although the HTTP standard specifies "unauthorized", semantically this response means "unauthenticated". That is, the client must authenticate itself to get the requested response.
	  403 = Forbidden = The client does not have access rights to the content; that is, it is unauthorized, so the server is refusing to give the requested resource. Unlike 401 Unauthorized, the client's identity is known to the server.

Publicis Sapient
in my report  		
 eg: by converting chars to String
 char ch= s1.charAt(i);
 String s2= Character.toString(ch); 
 
 declaration of Character class= 
 public final class Character implements java.io.Serializable, Comparable<Character>
 {
   }
 
 many String class methods we have used:
 String s1="Hello";
 s1.length()
 s1.charAt()
 s1.contains()
 s1.substring()
 String.valueOf()  //to convert all primitive data type to String
 
 declaration/internal implementation of String class
 public final class String implements java.io.Serializable, Comparable<String>, CharSequence 
  {
    }
